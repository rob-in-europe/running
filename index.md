## Running form and shin splints

[It's all in the hips](http://www.runnersworld.com/injury-prevention-recovery/its-all-in-the-hips),
writes *Jonathan Beverly*, good form starts with the pelvis and the glutes.
He also writes about the importance of cadence and posture for
[improving form](http://www.runnersworld.com/injury-prevention-recovery/form-fixes).
I've been trying to overcome posterior shin splints for a while now, and the
very first time I tried to make these changes to my form, I felt significantly
more comfortable.
[Toe raises](http://gizmodo.com/5902699/banish-shin-splints-forever-with-one-magical-exercise)
and [other exercises](http://runnerunleashed.com/2013/06/14/posterior-shin-splints/)
have also proven quite useful, as have a number of discussions on
[/r/running](https://www.reddit.com/r/running) and
[/r/fitness](https://www.reddit.com/r/fitness) (search for *shin splints*).

More generally, it's important to know
[how to warm up](http://skorarunning.com/blog/warm-up), to be aware of useful
[stretches](http://athletestreatingathletes.com/five-favorite-stretches-for-runners/)
and [yoga exercises](http://sagerountree.com/shop/videos-2/yoga-videos/) for
runners, and exercises for
[hip flexors and glute strength](https://www.t-nation.com/training/dispelling-the-glute-myth).
Jonathan Savage maintains an extensive
[wiki](http://fellrnr.com/wiki/Main_Page), including an interesting article
about [how often to run](http://fellrnr.com/wiki/How_Often_To_Run) and lots
of [product reviews](http://fellrnr.com/wiki/Product_Reviews) including a
huge number of [running shoes](http://fellrnr.com/wiki/Shoes).
